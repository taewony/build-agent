# SPAK: A Formally Verified, Spec-Driven Kernel for Programmable Agent Software Synthesis

## Abstract

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled autonomous software generation, yet current agentic frameworks often suffer from non-determinism, lack of interpretability, and uncontrolled side effects. Existing approaches predominantly rely on prompt engineering or social orchestration (multi-agent chat), which fails to guarantee adherence to rigorous architectural constraints or functional correctness beyond simple unit tests.

In this paper, we introduce the **Spec-Driven Programmable Agent Kernel (SPAK)**, a novel architecture that treats Agent software synthesis as a formal compilation process rather than probabilistic text generation. SPAK introduces three key innovations: (1) **Semantic Intermediate Representation (AgentSpec)**, a domain-specific language (DSL) that formalizes agent intent, interfaces, and invariants separate from implementation; (2) an **Algebraic Effect-based Runtime Kernel**, which isolates the agent's decision-making policy from execution, ensuring complete observability and safety of side effects; and (3) a **Recursive Verification Loop**, where agents self-correct by iteratively refining code against language-agnostic test vectors and static structural analysis.

We evaluate SPAK on a suite of complex software engineering tasks, demonstrating that our spec-driven approach significantly outperforms standard zero-shot and chain-of-thought methods in generating structurally correct and secure code. Furthermore, we show that our kernel's recursive architecture allows for the deterministic synthesis of complex, hierarchical systems, effectively bridging the gap between natural language intent and reliable, verifiable software execution. Our work proposes a shift from "prompting agents" to "programmable agent kernels," offering a foundation for the next generation of reliable AI-assisted software engineering.
